Info:
Blood plasma levels of retinol and beta-carotene have been found to have an inverse
association with cancer development. The analyzed data was collected from 315 patients
who previously underwent a biopsy or removal procedure of a lesion found noncancerous
from the lung, uterus, colon, breast, skin, or ovary. In particular, this study sought to
determine the effect consuming alcohol and smoking had on beta-carotene and retinol
concentrations. Which factors could be used to best predict plasma levels and whether
the inclusion of interactions improved predictive ability was also questioned. Models of
both responses contained age as a significant predictor. Retinol was found to have a
significant positive relationship with alcohol consumption and age between both models.
The addition of interactions to the reintol model did not cause notable improvement.
Smoking status became significant in the beta-carotene model when interactions were
included. Sex, age, vitamin use, fiber, quetelet, and cholesterol were significant predictors
between both the beta-carotene models. Overall, the R2
a value for retinol was 0.09312 and
0.1046 for the first order and interaction model respectively, and 0.2037 and 0.3074 for
the beta-carotene first order and interaction model.
